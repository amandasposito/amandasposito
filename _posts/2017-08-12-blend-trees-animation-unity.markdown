I'm working on a personal project using the Unity engine to build a game in 2D and recently I've discovered a new way of creating animations based on the character physics.

There are some ways you can animate a 2D character and maybe the most common one is to simple use the sprites to build a animation, by placing the slices of the sprite into the time line of the animation.
