This was `TIL` for me, so I thought it would be worth a quick post. ðŸ™‚

**TL; DR;**

```elixir
Repo.all from u in User,
         preload: [{:investiment_funds, :institution}, :transfers]
```

Ecto is designed to not bring associations alongside the main data in the query to avoid N+1 problems.

If you want, you need to explicitly say what is that you want to bring together in the query.

To do that you need to use the `preload` macro to load the `associations` into the given query.

Imagine you are at investment scenario where you want to fetch all users and list their investment funds, you would need something like that to `preload` the `investment funds`.

```elixir
Repo.all from u in User,
         preload: [:investiment_funds]
```

Now, imagine you also need to list the transfers that the user did.

```elixir
Repo.all from u in User,
         preload: [:investiment_funds, :transfers]
```

No problem so far, this is all covered by the Ecto documentation.

But now imagine you need to show in the `investment funds` list, the fund `institution` that is stored in a different table.

`User -> Investment Fund -> Institution`

You don't need to use joins or anything like that in order to make it work, you will only need to pass the `nested associations` inside the curly brackets and everything should work now.

```elixir
Repo.all from u in User,
         preload: [{:investiment_funds, :institution}, :transfers]
```

Hope it helps!
